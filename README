Motivation:

Lung cancer continues to be a major source of cancer-related deaths in several countries, including the home countries of each of the team members. 
A significant challenge facing the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is the stark molecular heterogeneity of lung tumors, which also vary among 
patients with the same histological type of lung tumor. Therefore, our team decided to concentrate on transcriptomic analysis of the most prevalent type of 
lung cancer (lung adenocarcinoma) using RNA-seq transcriptomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-LUAD) dataset. 

Goals:

The goal of our analysis is to provide a visual representation of the transcriptomic heterogeneity across lung adenocarcinoma samples (inter-tumor heterogeneity) and within specific lung adenocarcinoma subgroups (intra-tumor heterogeneity). We also aim to explore how gene expression variation relates to relevant demographic factors (such as age and race) and clinical factors (such as tumor severity), which may help facilitate diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy, and therapeutic strategies in the clinical oncology domain.
